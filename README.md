##🌸 Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🌸

Hi there! I’m Elisa 💻✨

I’m an architecture student and a beginner in software development, discovering how creativity and technology can come together 💡🏗️

Currently, I work at Bosch, in Joinville, Brazil 🇧🇷
I absolutely love web design and everything related to beautiful, functional interfaces 🎨💖

I’m still learning — but I’m having lots of fun along the way! 🌱
Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy my projects! 🌷💫
